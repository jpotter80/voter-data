# Buncombe County Voter Demographics Analysis

This repository hosts a comprehensive analysis of voter demographics in Buncombe County, North Carolina. Utilizing R and its powerful libraries, we dive deep into the data to uncover the intricate patterns of voting behavior and demographic intersections within this region. Our project aims to provide stakeholders, policymakers, and the general public with actionable insights into the demographics of voters, focusing on their party affiliations, racial compositions, gender distributions, age groups, and geographic distributions across zip codes and school districts.

## Project Overview

The project is structured into several key analyses, each dedicated to exploring different facets of voter demographics:

- **Party Affiliation Analysis**: Investigates how voters are distributed across political parties, and how these affiliations correlate with race, gender, age groups, and school districts.
- **Race Demographics Analysis**: Explores the racial composition of the electorate, examining how race influences voting behavior, intersects with gender and age, and varies geographically.
- **Gender Analysis**: Delves into the gender distribution among voters, analyzing how gender relates to party affiliation, intersects with race, and varies across different age groups.
- **Age Analysis**: Focuses on the age distribution of voters, looking at how age influences party affiliation and intersects with gender and race.
- **Geographic Analysis**: Examines voter distribution across zip codes and school districts, exploring patterns of party affiliation, racial composition, and demographic intersections within these areas.
- **Cross-Variable Analysis**: Provides a nuanced exploration of the intersectionality of race, gender, party affiliation, and age, offering a multidimensional view of voter demographics.

Each section is supported by R scripts complete with detailed comments explaining the methodologies used for data cleaning, organization, analysis, and visualization. These scripts serve as a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand or replicate the analysis.
